# Structure and Semantics of Sentence Embeddings 
This repository houses the experiments as detailed in the paper "A Comparative Study on Structural and Semantic Properties of Sentence Embeddings".
To run the experiments on your own machine, begin by creating the necessary datasets as detailed in the data/ directory. Next, generate the embedding sets for the knowledge graph in kg-embeddings/.
Generate all the sentence embeddings by following the README in the sentence-embeddings/ directory. 
To create the maps, follow the instructions in align/.
Finally, run the clustering experiments in cluster/.
